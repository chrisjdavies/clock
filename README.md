# Super Simple Clock for VS Code

![Clock](images/icon.png)

A super simple, open source status-bar clock for Visual Studio Coe.

There seem to be lots of status bar clock extensions for Visual Studio Code, but
nearly all of them are closed-source?  Something so simple should surely be free
and open -- so here we go.

## Configuration

|Property|Description|Type|Default value|
|---|---|---|---|
|`clock.format24Hour`|Display a 24-hour clock.|Boolean|`true`|

## Thanks

- Thanks to DALL-E 3 for generating the icon/logo.
